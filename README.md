## Master Branch Has been updated (Update 3/15/2020 17:55pm)
The current state Master Branch fulfills
- ~~Maintain the basic functionality of AddressBook.java after modification~~ 
- additional non-GUI class and functions has been updated, which already fulfills all project 2's Further requirements as mentioned in project detail
- Data base linking method has replaced file reading method
- Menu.java is found useless but still remains for reference purpose

## What is needed
- ~~The main GUI interface~~
- event handling classes
- GUI must interact with AddressBook class, for AddressBook class being the base of data holding (model)
- AddressBook class will need modification as GUI development extends

## Personal Branch update by John.G & Yucheng.Z (Update 3/15/2020 17:55pm)
- Updated AddressBook.java, moved sorting to add method, remove method supports local and database remove (change your database user name and password and update your format to match with your own data base)
- AddressBook.java now is a public class with non-static methods
- Basic GUI framework has been added that contains all basic UI navigation but yet no modification towards data event handling (in progress...)
- Finished solution to add new entry to data base, requires data base console modification as well for sequence entry (add method for DB has yet to be implemented for the project)
